Being inspired by the, also awesome, [[https://github.com/plexus/chestnut][Chestnut]] template
Tenzing offers the following features:

1. Incremental Clojurescript compilation
1. Live reloading of your Javascript, CSS, etc.
1. Browser-REPL

*There are some significant differences though:*

1. Tenzing uses [[https://github.com/boot-clj/boot][Boot]] instead of Leiningen (see below)
1. Tenzing does not provide a backend layer (see below)
1. Tenzing allows you to choose between Om, Reagent and others

*Tenzing is work in progress, please [[https://github.com/martinklepsch/tenzing][report issues]] as you encounter them!*

* Rationale
** Why Boot?
In contrast to Leiningen Boot offers a clear strategy when it comes to
composing multi-step build processes such as compiling stylesheets and
Javascript whenever a relevant file changes.

Many Leinigen plugins come with an `auto` task that allows similar
behavior. If you want to run multiple of those tasks it's usually done
by starting multiple JVM instances which can lead to [[https://github.com/plexus/chestnut/issues/49][high memory
usage]]. Boot allows this sort of behaviour to reside in one JVM process
while making sure that build steps don't interfere with each other.

You can learn more about Boot in [[http://adzerk.com/blog/2014/11/clojurescript-builds-rebooted/][a blog post by one of the authors]],
it's [[https://github.com/boot-clj/boot][github project]] or [[http://www.martinklepsch.org/posts/why-boot-is-relevant-for-the-clojure-ecosystem.html][a blog post I wrote about it]].

** Why #noBackend?
Tenzing is designed with prototyping in mind. Instead of writing your
own backend you're encouraged to use services like [[https://parse.com][Parse]], [[https://www.firebase.com][Firebase]],
[[http://usergrid.incubator.apache.org][Usergrid]] and others.

If you figure out that you need a Clojure based backend down the road
it's simple to either add it yourself or create it as a standalone
service that's being used by your clients.

Please, also consider [[http://alistapart.com/article/offline-first][offline first]] as an approach for building early
iterations of your application.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If you're wondering how files are served during development: there is
a boot task `serve` that allows you to serve static files.
#+END_QUOTE

* Usage
** Create a Project
To create a new project we piggieback the existing =lein new= tooling:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ lein new tenzing your-app
#+END_SRC

There are a bunch of options that determine what your newly created
project will contain:

- =+om= provides a basic [[https://github.com/omcljs/om][Om]] application and adds relevant dependencies
- =+reagent= provides a basic [[https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent][Reagent]] application and adds relevant dependencies
- =+divshot= adds divshot.json for easy deployment to [[https://divshot.com][Divshot]]
- =+garden= sets up [[https://github.com/noprompt/garden][Garden]] and integrates into the build process
- =+sass= sets up [[http://sass-lang.com][Sass]] and integrates into the build process (requires [[http://libsass.org][libsass]])
- =+less= sets up [[http://lesscss.org/][Less]] and integrates into the build process.
- =+test= adds a [[https://github.com/crisptrutski/boot-cljs-test][cljs test-runner]] and adds a =test= task.

If you want to add an option, [[https://github.com/martinklepsch/tenzing][pull-requests]] are welcome.

** Running it
After you [[https://github.com/boot-clj/boot#install][installed Boot]] you can run your Clojurescript application in
"development mode" by executing the following:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ boot dev
#+END_SRC

After a moment of waiting you can head to [[http://localhost:3000][localhost:3000]] to see a
small sample app. If you now go and edit one of the Clojurescript
source files or a SASS file (if you've used the =+sass= option) this
change will be picked up by Boot and the respective source file will
get compiled. When a compiled file changes through that mechanism it
will get pushed to the browser.

*** Connecting to the browser REPL
After you started your application with =boot dev= there will be a
line printed like the following:
#+BEGIN_SRC
nREPL server started on port 63518 on host 0.0.0.0
#+END_SRC
This means there now is an nREPL server that you can connect to. You
can do this with your favorite editor or just by running =boot repl
--client= in the same directory.

Once you are connected you can get into a Clojurescript REPL by running
=(start-repl)=. At this point I usually reload my browser one last time
to make sure the REPL connection is properly setup.

Now you can run things like =(.log js/console "test")=, which should
print "test" in the console of your browser.
*** How it works
If you look at the =build= and =run= tasks in the =build.boot= file of your
newly created project you will see something like the following:
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(deftask build []
  (comp (speak)
        (cljs)
        (sass :output-dir "css")))

(deftask run []
  (comp (serve)
        (watch)
        (cljs-repl)
        (reload)
        (build)))
#+END_SRC

Basically this composes all kinds of build steps into a unified =run= task
that will start our application. From top to bottom:

The =build= task consists of three other tasks:
- =speak= gives us audible notifications about our build process
- =cljs= will compile Clojurescript source files to Javascript
- =sass= will compile Sass source files to CSS

Now if we just run =boot build= instead of the aforementioned =boot dev=
we will compile our Clojurescript and Sass exactly once and then the program
will terminate.

This is where the =run= task comes in:
- =serve= starts a webserver that will serve our compiled JS, CSS and anything else that is in =resources/=
- =watch= will watch our filesystem for changes and trigger new builds when they occur
- =cljs-repl= sets up various things so we can connect to our application through a browser REPL
- =reload= will watch the compiled files for changes and push them to the browser
- =build= does the things already described above

*Please note that all tasks, except the one we defined ourselves have extensive documentation that you can view by running =boot <taskname> -h= (e.g. =boot cljs-repl -h=).*
** Deployment
The easiest way to deploy your app is using [[https://divshot.com][Divshot]]:

1. =$ divshot login=
1. add [[https://github.com/martinklepsch/tenzing/blob/master/resources/leiningen/new/tenzing/divshot.json][divshot.json]] (Only required if your project hasn't been created with the =+divshot= option.)
   #+BEGIN_SRC json
   {"name": "your-app",
    "root": "target",
    "clean_urls": true,
    "error_page": "error.html"}
   #+END_SRC
1. =$ divshot push=

Since Tenzing comes without a backend you can also easily deploy
your app to Amazon S3 or even host it in your Dropbox. To do that
just copy the files in =target/= to your desired location.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
PS. A nice tool to easily deploy to S3 from the command line is [[https://github.com/EagerIO/Stout][stout]].
